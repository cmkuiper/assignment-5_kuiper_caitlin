I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

## Comments
- I added a version tag in my terminal after setting up my files, but it isn't displaying in GitHub. I tried to add it again and received a message that the version tag already exists. I've attached screenshots for your review.
- In my custom listeners, I was able to add a new paragraph when mousing over the H1, but the paragraph gets added to the bottom of the page. How do I target where that paragraph is added?
